# Installation
To install the crontab, copy `crontab` into the clipboard, execute `crontab -e` in your shell of choice, paste, and change the path according to where screen_sample.app actually is on your filesystem.
There is a path stored in the variable $root in label.pl. That needs to be adapted to your environment.
